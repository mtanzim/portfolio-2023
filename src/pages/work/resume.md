## Work Experience

### Member of Technical Staff, [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) | Toronto, Canada, Mar 2024 - Present

- Cohere empowers developers and enterprise with large language models (LLM)
- I am developing an application to enable enterprise customers to leverage retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on their data sources, including email, messaging, and distributed drives
- Key challenges include creating scalable backends for data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval, and integrating them seamlessly with a modern UI for chat, data management, and search functionalities
- I am also developing essential features for Cohere's self-serve platform, including billing, playground, and onboarding processes
- My primary focus is on the backend, utilizing `Go`, `Python`, `Postgres`, `Redis`, `Kubernetes`, `GCP`, and `AWS`
- For versatility and maintaining frontend competence, I am also developing full-stack features using `NextJS` and `Typescript`
- As a mentor, I provide guidance on best practices for system design, software design, testing, and documentation

### Senior Software Engineer, [Flipp](https://flipp.com/home) | Toronto, Canada, Jan 2021 - Mar 2024

- Flipp helps North American shoppers save money by aggregating deals and flyers
- I am working on a greenfield web application enabling Flipp’s retail partners design digital flyers, leading the charge in migrating off print flyers towards a digital solution
- Key challenges include establishing best practices for building a modern web UI with drag and drop interactions, alongside developing backend APIs and microservices. Frontend technologies include `React`, `Typescript` and `Storybook`, while `Go`, `NodeJS`, `Ruby`, `Kafka`, `AWS`, `Github Actions` and `Kubernetes` are critical on the backend.
- Mentoring peers on concepts such as functional reactive programming, atomic design, concurrency, and testing
- Continuously analyzing and improving existing systems: reduced endpoint latency by 35x through concurrent `Go` code optimization, simplified system architecture by consolidating scattered code across services and languages into a sub-500 LOC `Typescript` package
- On a similar spirit, I have led multiple award-winning hackathon and R&D initiatives. One project enabled automated flyer curation within a full stack `NextJS` app, integrating with OpenAI's `GPT-3.5` large language model (`LLM`). A follow up project enabled semantic search of private product data using retrieval augmented generation (`RAG`): leveraging a locally hosted vector database (`ChromaDB`), and an open source LLM (`mistral:7b`)

### Mentor, [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) | Remote, Feb 2022 - May 2023

- Mentored aspiring web developers in soft skills and industry processes, offering comprehensive guidance, feedback, and support in a MERN stack curriculum

### Full Stack Engineer, [Moonfare](https://www.moonfare.com/) | Berlin, Germany, Jan 2020 - Jan 2021

- Moonfare makes investing in private equity easy, currently managing over €2.5 billion in assets
- I played a key role in developing new features and scaling the core web application to support business growth while refactoring to enhance performance and reduce technical debt; in one case endpoint latency was improved 89% through database and algorithm optimizations
- Mentored developers through code reviews and educational sessions

### Full Stack Engineer, [Diginex](https://www.diginex.com/) | Berlin, Germany, Dec 2018 - Dec 2019

- At Diginex, a blockchain technology company, I developed a cryptocurrency trading platform for algorithmic and manual trading, and worked on internal tools for backtesting arbitrage models, load testing, and supporting financial data transfer protocols. I utilized `Python`, `Pandas`, `Postgres`, and `AWS` in the backend, and `React` with `RxJS` on the frontend.
