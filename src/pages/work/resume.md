## Work Experience

### Senior Software Engineer, [Flipp](https://flipp.com/home) | Toronto, Canada, Jan 2021 - Present

- Flipp helps North American shoppers save money by aggregating deals and flyers
- I am working on a greenfield web application enabling Flipp’s retail partners design digital flyers, leading the charge in migrating off print flyers towards a digital solution
- Key challenges include establishing best practices for building a modern web UI with drag and drop interactions, alongside developing backend APIs and microservices. Frontend technologies include `React`, `Typescript` and `Storybook`, while `Go`, `NodeJS`, `Ruby`, `Kafka`, `AWS`, `Github Actions` and `Kubernetes` are critical on the backend.
- Mentoring peers on concepts such as functional reactive programming, atomic design, concurrency, and testing
- Critically analyzing existing systems to improve efficiency and developer experience. A few award winning hackathon efforts include:
  - Automating flyer curation by prompting `GPT-3.5`, while also providing user intervention with a full stack `NextJS` app
  - Reduced endpoint latency by 35x through the use of worker pools to fix concurrent `Go` code
  - Simplifying the system architecture by reverse engineering 10K+ LOC scattered across services in `Typescript`, `Ruby` and `Go` to a single sub 500 LOC `Typescript` package
  - Architecture simplification and concurrency fixes were promptly taken to production. Curation automation is currently serving as a pioneering example.

### Mentor, [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) | Remote, Feb 2022 - Present

- Mentoring the next generation of web developers on soft skills and processes to penetrate and achieve success within the software industry
- Providing technical guidance, assignment feedback, code review, and debug support around a curriculum focusing on the `MERN` Stack

### Full Stack Engineer, [Moonfare](https://www.moonfare.com/) | Berlin, Germany, Jan 2020 - Jan 2021

- Moonfare makes investing in private equity easy, currently managing over €2.5 billion in assets
- Developed new features for Moonfare’s core web application and taking on the technical challenges to scale the business for a growing client base
- Challenges include designing database models, microservices, and user interfaces in addition to refactoring pre-existing software to improve performance and reduce tech debt
- In one case, I improved endpoint latency by 89% by optimizing asynchronous functions, database queries, and search algorithms
- Mentored fellow developers in algorithms, software design and database management through code reviews, documentation, and educational sessions
- Developed using a `Typescript` based tech stack with `NodeJS`, `React`, and `MySQL`

### Full Stack Engineer, [Diginex](https://www.diginex.com/) | Berlin, Germany, Dec 2018 - Dec 2019

- Diginex pioneers blockchain based tools for governments and corporations, working with institutions such as the UN and Microsoft
- I helped develop a cryptocurrency trading platform that aggregates price data and allows algorithmic and manual trading across exchanges
- I worked on internal tools for backtesting arbitrage models using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, load testing, and supporting financial data transfer protocols
- Our tech stack and design principles focused on supporting data streams, analytics, and visualization: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Postgres`, and `Redis` on the backend, `React` with `RxJS` on the frontend, and `AWS` for encryption and user authentication

### Contract Backend Engineer, [ReloTalent](https://relotalent.com) | Hanoi, Vietnam, Mar 2018 - May 2018

- Developed a microservice to implement an iterative mathematical model for determining salaries during relocation considering tax rates, cost of living, and personal investments using `Python`, `SQL`, and `AWS Lambda`
