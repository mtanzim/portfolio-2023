## Work Experience

### Member of Technical Staff, [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) | Toronto, Canada, Mar 2024 - Present

- Cohere empowers developers and enterprise with large language models (LLM)
- I am developing an application to enable enterprise customers to leverage retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on their data sources, including email, messaging, and distributed drives. This involves using Cohere's solutions for embeddings, chat, and search.
- The key challenges I am addressing include creating scalable backends for data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval, and integrating them seamlessly with a modern UI for chat, data management, and search functionalities
- I am also contributing to the development of essential features for Cohere's self-serve platform, including payments, billing, playground, and onboarding processes.
- My primary focus is on the backend, utilizing `Go`, `Python`, `Postgres`, `Redis`, `Kubernetes`, `GCP`, and `AWS`. I work extensively with REST and gRPC APIs and ensure scalability using queue-based technologies.
- For versatility and maintaining frontend competence, I occasionally build full-stack features using `NextJS` and `Typescript`
- As a mentor within the team, I provide guidance on best practices for software design, testing, and documentation. I emphasize building quickly while ensuring quality and scalability.

### Senior Software Engineer, [Flipp](https://flipp.com/home) | Toronto, Canada, Jan 2021 - Mar 2024

- Flipp helps North American shoppers save money by aggregating deals and flyers
- I am working on a greenfield web application enabling Flipp’s retail partners design digital flyers, leading the charge in migrating off print flyers towards a digital solution
- Key challenges include establishing best practices for building a modern web UI with drag and drop interactions, alongside developing backend APIs and microservices. Frontend technologies include `React`, `Typescript` and `Storybook`, while `Go`, `NodeJS`, `Ruby`, `Kafka`, `AWS`, `Github Actions` and `Kubernetes` are critical on the backend.
- Mentoring peers on concepts such as functional reactive programming, atomic design, concurrency, and testing
- Continuously analyzing and improving existing systems: reduced endpoint latency by 35x through concurrent `Go` code optimization, simplified system architecture by consolidating scattered code across services and languages into a sub-500 LOC `Typescript` package
- On a similar spirit, I have led multiple award-winning hackathon and R&D initiatives. One project enabled automated flyer curation within a full stack `NextJS` app, integrating with OpenAI's `GPT-3.5` large language model (`LLM`). A follow up project enabled semantic search of private product data using retrieval augmented generation (`RAG`): leveraging a locally hosted vector database (`ChromaDB`), and an open source LLM (`mistral:7b`)

### Mentor, [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) | Remote, Feb 2022 - May 2023

- Mentored aspiring web developers in soft skills and industry processes, offering comprehensive guidance, feedback, and support in a MERN stack curriculum

### Full Stack Engineer, [Moonfare](https://www.moonfare.com/) | Berlin, Germany, Jan 2020 - Jan 2021

- Moonfare makes investing in private equity easy, currently managing over €2.5 billion in assets
- Developed new features for Moonfare’s core web application and taking on the technical challenges to scale the business for a growing client base
- Challenges include designing database models, microservices, and user interfaces in addition to refactoring pre-existing software to improve performance and reduce tech debt
- In one case, I improved endpoint latency by 89% by optimizing asynchronous functions, database queries, and search algorithms
- Mentored fellow developers in algorithms, software design and database management through code reviews, documentation, and educational sessions
- Developed using a `Typescript` based tech stack with `NodeJS`, `React`, and `MySQL`

### Full Stack Engineer, [Diginex](https://www.diginex.com/) | Berlin, Germany, Dec 2018 - Dec 2019

- At Diginex, a blockchain technology company, I developed a cryptocurrency trading platform for algorithmic and manual trading, and worked on internal tools for backtesting arbitrage models, load testing, and supporting financial data transfer protocols. I utilized `Python`, `Pandas`, `Postgres`, and `AWS` in the backend, and `React` with `RxJS` on the frontend.

### Contract Backend Engineer, [ReloTalent](https://relotalent.com) | Hanoi, Vietnam, Mar 2018 - May 2018

- Developed a microservice to implement an iterative mathematical model for determining salaries during relocation considering tax rates, cost of living, and personal investments using `Python`, `SQL`, and `AWS Lambda`

### Sr. Product Development Engineer, [Advanced Micro Devices](https://amd.com/en) | Toronto, Canada, Jun 2012 - Nov 2017

- Led the development of system-level test programs and yield analysis with a global team for AMD Radeon products, receiving two Spotlight awards for contributing to over $US 900,000 in company savings
