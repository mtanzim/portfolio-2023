  <p class="text-base">
    I stumbled on web development by coincidence. I was chatting with a stranger
    at a party, and they mentioned they were going through the

      href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"

    > curriculum to make a career switch. At the time, I was working as a product
    engineer, wearing many different hats. However, throughout the years I became
    conflicted by the lack of technical challeges of my position. Inspired by the
    story, I thought I'd give freecodecamp a try as well!
    <br />
    <br />
    It was not exactly love at first sight, but by the time I made it to the <code
      >React</code
    > part of the curriculum, I was hooked! I'd always enjoyed software development,
    however I was plagued by imposter syndrome. Making steady progress on the curriculum
    started to give me confidence.
    <br />
    <br />
    A few months down the road, I decided I would leave my career, and try my hand
    at being a digital nomad. I did not plan to be earning money, but I felt getting
    through the curriculum would provide a sense of progress and productivity. I
    set sail for Hanoi, Vietnam. The year long backpacking and digital nomading become
    a pivotal point in my life and career. I was able to get through critical parts
    of the curriculum, build a few projects, and even land a contract position. My
    initial projects' <code>Heroku</code> deploys are now dead, but here are a few
    pictures:

        Google translate is great at translating documentation! I had worked on
        a blog project with these guys, and it helped me realize how little
        React and Javascript I knew at the time.

        I was probably building my very first full stack SPA: a recipe app. The
        roost stand and the Dell XPS took me far.

        I really have to thank the Relotalent team for giving me a shot. All I
        had to do was keenly listen to the issues of Italian politics.
        Thankfully my Python and SQL skills from a past life came clutch.

      After about a year in Asia, I decided I'd move to Berlin. This was the
      first time I realized how difficult

      would be. Unfortunately, I was not aware of the book at the time, and also
      did not have the background in computer science. After many failed attempts,
      I landed my first full time software engineering job at Diginex. Once again,
      on the job, I realized how little I actually knew. Thankfully, there was enough
      downtime at work to support my thirst for deeper knowlegde. I really have to
      thank

      and experience I gathered through these courses have made a big difference
      in my career. Similarly, my experience working in Berlin and the city's tech
      culture have made a big impact to my personal and professional life.

      At the height of COVID the pandemic, I realized it was time to come back
      home to Toronto, Canada. I am currently writing the next chapters here.
