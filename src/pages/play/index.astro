        I've always loved listening to music. Recently, I've started collecting
        vinyls and CDs. Vinyls are a magical experience, and the sound quality
        of CDs paired with a good system is hard to match. Here are a few albums
        I currently have on repeat:
      </p>
      <div class="my-6 h-1/2 max-w-full">
        <Carousel images={TopAlbumImgs} />
      </div>
      <p>
        However, the convenience of streaming services is unbeatable. In
        addition, it's easy to collect data on yourself with them! For example,
        following is a glimpse of my affinity towards musical genres from the
        last few years:
      </p>
      <div class="my-6 h-1/2 max-w-full">
        <Genres data={json as SpotifyArtists} client:only />
      </div>

      This is based on my data on Spotify and you can generate a similar one
      through my <a
        class="badge badge-secondary"
        target="_blank"
        href={"https://spotify-personal-ybmvkz22xq-uc.a.run.app/"}>web app</a
      >.
