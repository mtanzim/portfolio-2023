      I've always loved listening to music. Recently, I've started collecting
      vinyls and CDs. Vinyls are a magical experience, and the sound quality of
      CDs paired with a good system is hard to match. Here are a few albums I
      currently have on repeat.

    <div class="my-6 h-1/2 max-w-full">
      <Carousel images={TopAlbumImgs} />
    </div>

      However, the convenience of streaming services is unmatched. In addition,
      it's easy to collect data on yourself with them! For example, following is
      a glimpse into my affinity towards musical genres from the last few years.
    </p>
    <div class="my-6 h-1/2 max-w-full">
      <Genres data={json as SpotifyArtists} client:only />
    </div>

    This is based on my data on Spotify and you can generate a similar one
    through my <a
      class="badge badge-secondary"
      target="_blank"
      href={"https://spotify-personal-ybmvkz22xq-uc.a.run.app/"}>web app</a
    >.
